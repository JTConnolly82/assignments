Project Requirements:

    _ Console must greet player with a fun message
    _ Console must ask for the player's name and store it
    Walking:

    _ The console will ask the user to enter a "w" to walk
    _ Every time the player walks, a random algorithm will be run that determines if a wild enemy has appeared (A 1/3 or 1/4 chance of being attacked)


    If a wild enemy appears:

    _ The enemy is random (can be chosen out of a minimum of 3 different enemy names)
    _ The user can decide to attack or run
    _ If attacking, you will choose a random attack power between a min and max
    _ If running, you will choose a random number between 1 and 2 - meaning a 50% chance of escaping
    _ After the player attacks or runs the enemy attacks back for a random damage amount
    _ If the player kills the enemy you can give the Player some HP and a special item that is stored in the inventory
    _ If the enemy kills the player the console prints an cool death message and the game ends


    Inventory

    _ When the player kills enemies, they are awarded with items
    _ If the user enters 'Print' in the console, the console will print the players name, HP, and each item in their inventory
